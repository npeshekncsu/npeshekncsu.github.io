## What do you think being a data scientist is about? 

A data scientist is a professional who uses their skills in various fields such as statistics, programming, data analysis, and domain expertise to extract insights and knowledge from sets of data. They play a crucial role in helping organizations make informed decisions by analyzing data to uncover patterns, trends, correlations, and other valuable information. They might also design data modeling processes or create algorithms to find and analyze that data. Key responsibilities of a data scientist include:
  - Data Collection and Cleaning
  - Data Exploration
  - Model Building
  - Feature Engineering
  - Model Training and Evaluation
  - Data Interpretation
  - Communication
  - Continual Learning




## What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?

**Major duties:**
  - **Data Collection and Wrangling** - gathering data from diverse sources and ensuring its quality and consistency.
  - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** - using statistical techniques and visualization tools to understand the structure, patterns, and relationships within the data.
  - **Feature Engineering** - selecting and transforming relevant variables to enhance model performance.
  - **Model Building** - developing predictive and analytical models using machine learning algorithms.
  - **Model Evaluation** - assessing model accuracy, reliability, and generalization using appropriate metrics
  - **Interpretation and Communication** - translating complex analytical results into actionable insights for non-technical stakeholders and effectively communicating findings through reports, presentations, and visualizations
  - **Problem-Solving and Creativity** - identifying relevant business or research problems that can be solved using data-driven approaches and developing creative solutions to challenges that arise during data analysis.

 **Knowledge areas**
  - **Machine Learning** - knowledge of various algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, etc.
  - **Statistics** - applying statistical methods to analyze data and draw conclusions
  - **Programming** - proficiency in languages like Python or R
  - **Big Data and Cloud Computing** - understanding of tools like Hadoop, Spark, and Polars for managing and analyzing large datasets and awareness of cloud platforms for scalable data processing
  - **Domain Expertise** - familiarity with the specific industry or field being analyzed
  - **Database Management** - knowledge of relational databases and non-relational databases
  - **Ethics and Privacy** - understanding of legal and ethical considerations in data analysis
