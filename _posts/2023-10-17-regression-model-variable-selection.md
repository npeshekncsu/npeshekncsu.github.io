Variable selection in regression – identifying the best subset among many variables to include in a model – 
is a critical step in building an accurate and interpretable predictive model. The goal is to choose a subset of variables 
that have a meaningful impact on the target variable while avoiding overfitting.  
Many variable selection methods exist. I this blog I want to discuss my approach to select the variables 
to use in a regression model.
