Variable selection in regression – identifying the best subset among many variables to include in a model – 
is a critical step in building an accurate and interpretable predictive model. The goal is to choose a subset of variables 
that have a meaningful impact on the target variable while avoiding overfitting.  
Many variable selection methods exist. 

In this blog I want to discuss my approach to select the variables to use in a regression model.

1. **Data Exploration**


   I am always start with performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain a deeper understanding of the data. Summary statistics, visualizations, etc., in the context of the problem which supposed to be solved with regression model helps to indetify important variables which should be included in the model.
2. **Domain expertise**

   
   Leverage domain expertise, consult with subject matter experts or do self-research to identify variables that are likely to be significant in explaining the target variable. Their insights can guide variable selection.

   
3. **Correlation Analysis**

   
   Calculate correlation coefficients to identify variables that are highly correlated with the response variable. Variables with strong correlations may be important predictors.

   
4. **Stepwise procedures**

   
   Stepwise regression techniques, such as forward selection, backward elimination, or best subset selection selection, systematically add or remove variables based on their contribution to the model's goodness of fit (e.g., AIC, BIC). These methods can be useful for automatic feature selection.

6. **Lasso Regression (L1 regularization)**

   
   It's a powerful tool for automatic variable selection by driving less significant variables' coefficients to zero, promoting a balance between feature selection and model regularization.
