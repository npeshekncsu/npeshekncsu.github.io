# Strategy for doing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## What is EDA and goal of the EDA

EDA is a important initial step in the machine learning, statistical inference and data analysis. It involves systematically examining and visualizing datasets to gain insights, discover patterns, and uncover potential relationships among variables. The goal of the EDA is to understand the structure and characteristics of data sets, identify outliers, missing values, and anomalies, and assess the assumptions of statistical models. Using techniques such as data visualization, summary statistics, and data transformation, EDA aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the data, guiding subsequent data modeling and hypothesis testing. It is an essential tool for making informed decisions, generating hypotheses, and ultimately deriving meaningful conclusions from complex datasets.

## EDA strategy

**1. Data Cleaning**


  - Understand missing values in the data set
  - Address missing values by imputing them or removing rows/columns with missing data (removing missing data is usually not recommeded but in case of large data set or small percentage of missing values, this approach is accepatble).
  - Standardize or normalize numerical variables if needed to ensure consistency.

**2.Summary Statistics**
