## What would you do differently?

I would probably consider training all models on a more powerful machine. Algorithms like random forests and SVMs, especially for large datasets with many predictors and several hyperparameters, tend to be slow. I was forced to reduce the number of predictors and hyperparameters to complete the training process. 

## What was the most difficult part for you?

The most difficult part for me was figuring out how to complete training for all education levels on my local machine. I struggled due to performance issues and a lack of resources on my machine.

## What are your big take-aways from this project?

I've learned a lot about log loss and the benefits of using it instead of accuracy as a metric. I am planning to actively use log loss at my work.
