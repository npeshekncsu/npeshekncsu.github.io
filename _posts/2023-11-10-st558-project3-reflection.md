## What would you do differently?

I would probably consider training all models on a more powerful machine. Algorithms like random forests and SVMs, especially for large datasets with many predictors and several hyperparameters to tune, tend to be slow. I was forced to reduce the number of predictors and hyperparameters to be able to complete the training process on my local machine. Even with reductions mentioned earlier, it took me 2.5 hours to build all 5 reports. 

## What was the most difficult part for you?

The most difficult part for me was figuring out how to complete training for all education levels on my local machine. I struggled due to performance issues and a lack of resources on my machine.

## What are your big take-aways from this project?

I've learned a lot about log loss and the benefits of using it instead of accuracy as a metric. I am planning to actively use log loss during my work.
